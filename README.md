# Contact Management System in C++

This project is a simple Contact Management System built using C++. The program provides a user-friendly interface to manage contacts with the following features:

- **Add New Contacts**: Users can add contacts by entering their name, phone number, and email address.
- **View Contact List**: The system displays all saved contacts in a clear format.
- **Edit Existing Contacts**: Users can edit the name, phone number, or email address of existing contacts.
- **Delete Contacts**: Contacts can be easily removed from the list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Contacts are saved to a file, allowing them to be retained between program executions.

## Features

- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilizes classes and objects to encapsulate contact information.
- **File Handling**: Saves and loads contacts from a text file for persistent storage.
- **Simple and Clear Code**: The code is written with readability in mind, avoiding complex constructs and dynamic memory allocation.
